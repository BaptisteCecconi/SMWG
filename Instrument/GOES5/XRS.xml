      <Description>The X-ray monitor consisted of two ion chambers, mounted behind a slim rectangular field-of-view (48 deg x 3 deg) collimator made of lead-lined aluminum. The chamber for the lower wavelength band of 0.05 to 0.40 nanometer was filled with Xe-He mixture with an entry aperture made of 20 mil Be sheet. For the other band, 0.1-0.8 nm, the gas was Ar-He mixture and the aperture was a 2 mil Be. The threshold sensitivities were 1.0E-12 J per sq cm per s for the lower wavelength band, and 1.0E-11 J per sq cm per s for the higher band; each had a dynamic range of four decades. Entry of charged particle were prevented by the strong magnetic field located at the chamber windows.</Description>
