      <Description>The magnitude and direction of the magnetic field are measured by two redundant Schonstedt triaxial magnetometers located on a boom 3 m, and 2.7 m away from the spacecraft body. The electronics are located inside the body. The X, Y, Z component signals from the three axes are digitized by a 16-bit converter, at a sampling rate of 0.512 s. The sensitivity is 0.1 nT, and the range +/- 1000 nT. After temperature correction, and before (undescribed) stray-field correction, the accuracy is at about 1 nT level.</Description>
