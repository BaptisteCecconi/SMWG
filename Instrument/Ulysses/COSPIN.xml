      <Description>The objectives of this investigation are to study the energy, charge, and mass spectra of energetic charged particles in interplanetary space in the energy range from approximately 0.5 MeV/nucleon (for protons) to approximately 100 MeV/nucleon; and to study spatial gradients and the propagation of charged particles throughout the heliosphere by measuring absolute flux and vector anisotropy. The instrument consists of six charged-particle telescopes (CPT) and associated electronics. A high-energy telescope provides measurements of the chemical and isotopic composition and of the energy spectrum of the cosmic radiation above approximately 10 MeV/nucleon. A low-energy telescope (LET) extends chemical composition and spectral measurements downward to &lt;1 MeV/nucleon. The anisotropy telescopes, in conjunction with the LET, provide a means of determining the distribution of arrival directions in three dimensions of low-energy protons and He nuclei. A high-flux telescope provides measurements of the intensity and arrival direction of protons, He, C, N, O, and Fe-group nuclei in high-flux environments, such as intense solar flares or Jupiter's magnetosphere, where the other sensor systems may become saturated. Each CPT provides output to a data-processing unit (DPU). The electron telescope consists of a double Cerenkov and semiconductor detector telescope which interfaces with the DPU. The instrument has a mass of 14.6 kg including shielding and uses 14.6 W of power. The data rate is 80 bps in cruise mode and 160 bps in tracking mode.</Description>
