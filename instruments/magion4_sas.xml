The instrument is designed as the well-known step-frequency analyzer with two intermediate frequences: 465 kHz and 5 kHz.
The signals under analysis are as follows: (1) electric component, 1-400 kHz (32-2000 Hz); (2) magnetic component, 400 Hz - 20 kHz; (3) magnetic component, 32-2000 Hz (Bx, By, Bz selected through the multiplexer); (4) current density XZ, 0.4-20 kHz; (5) current density YZ, 0.4-20 kHz; (6) analog frequency range, 1-480 Hz divided into 8 subranges.
