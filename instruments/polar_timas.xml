      <Description>This investigation utilizes a toroidal ion mass spectrograph (TIMS) to fulfill its objectives, which are to study (1) the properties, location, and morphology of the principal source region for the entry of solar wind plasma into the magnetosphere, i.e., the polar cusp; (2) the properties, location, and morphology of the principal source region for hot ionospheric plasma in the magnetosphere, i.e., the auroral acceleration region; (3) the details of the processes by which the source plasmas are injected into trapped orbits, with special emphasis on the mass dependence of these processes; (4) details of the processes by which relatively cool source plasmas are energized into hot plasma, with special emphasis on the mass dependence of these processes; and (5) the details of the processes by which the hot magnetospheric plasma are lost, for example through wave-particle scattering and charge exchange, with special emphasis on the mass dependence of these processes. The instrument has a mass per charge range of 1 to 150 u/Q in 128 channels, with resolution (M/delta M) of 10, and an energy range of 0 to 40 keV/Q, with 32 energy steps logarithmically spaced and a resolution (delta E/E) of 0.08. The field of view covers 10 deg of azimuth and plus and minus 20 deg in elevation, with five elements of 8 deg each in elevation. The sample rate of 32 samples per second yields one mass-energy-angle spectrum per 4 spin periods. This instrument is identical to the instrument on ISTP/EQUATOR.</Description>
