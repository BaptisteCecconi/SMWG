      <Description>Akebono was launched on February 22, 1989, by
the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) predecessor to 
investigate magnetospheric phenomena associated with the acceleration 
of aurotal particles. The initial orbit had apogee/perigee altitudes 
of 10,482 km and 272 km, and had a 75.1 deg inclination. Its spin
vector was sun-pointing and its spin period was 8 sec. It carried
a full complement of plasma and energetic particle, electric and 
magnetic field, and wave detectors.  The spacecraft and its instruments
are described in J. Geomag. Geoelect. 42, 1990.</Description>
